# Yelp Dataset Challenge
## Valence Weakly Constrains the Information Density of Messages (Vinson etal, 2014)

### This manuscript was selected as the round two winner of Yelp's Dataset Challenge award. 

We used the Yelp, Inc. dataset from their round two Dataset Challenge containing ~229k reviews. 
We use this to explore the potential role of context in the observed information density of messages. 
User-related variables, such as the overall rating of a review, 
appear to have an interesting relationship to basic information-theoretic measures, 
such as the average amount and variability of observed information of a review's words. 
We discuss these results in terms of the broader context 
that may shape the information structure of messages, 
and relate these findings to existing theories.
